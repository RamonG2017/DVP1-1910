# Welcome to My Project & Portfolio Repository!

Hello and welcome to my first Project and Portfolio repository. Since the end of September 2019 to the last week of October 2019 I have been working on various coding challenges in C#. You will also see a couple of extra folders such as the **Header Text Files** folder which as the name suggests includes the ascii art for the headers of each challenge.

## Note to user

Please remember that if you wish to run my code you would need to change the repository inside the source code for each individual text file and challenge as it changes from computer A to computer B.
